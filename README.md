# Chatbot Project

## Overview  
This is a simple chatbot built using Python during my Year 10 studies. The chatbot is designed to engage in basic conversations, answer predefined questions, and provide simple responses based on user input.

## Features  
- Basic text-based interaction  
- Predefined responses for common questions  
- Simple pattern matching for improved conversation flow  
- User-friendly interface in the terminal  

## Technologies Used  
- Python  
- `random` module (for varied responses)  
- `time` module (for slight delays to simulate human-like interaction)
